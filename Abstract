Waste flasks fill up fast in labs that do a lot of cell culture. Keeping track of waste is a tedious task that causes conflict if lab members forget or neglect this chore. The waste flask can also overflow if seriously neglected, causing damage to the system. We propose to create a simple light-based sensor and alert system. This will sense whether the waste level is above a certain level, indicating that it is time for the container to be emptied. It will then email the lab member who is next in line to empty it. It will send several reminders and then threaten to email the member's boss if the alert goes unanswered.
