getting people to empty waste flasks is a pain and causes lab drama
With an automated system you decrease the need to have awkward conversations with your labmates and strain relationships
You can't claim it's not your turn because the system knows who's next! You can't claim you forgot because the system keeps track

a simple light sensor will give an alert when a flask is full
It will sense a difference in air in your flask compared to clear liquid (or any non-air thing inside the beaker) - could be non-clear liquid
It will do a check every minute to see the status of the flask

It will then send you several email reminders until you do it
If you don't, it will threaten to -- and ultimately will -- email your boss!
